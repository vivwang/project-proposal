###(keyboard transformation)
##Project 1- Breathe with Me
Due in a week
####My project is a flexible keyboard which can detect user's heart beat, play sound, inhale and exhale air. Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* Design a flexible keyboard which can accomplish inhale and exhale movement
(rubber keyboard cover)
* Play sound while it detects user's heart beat over a certain range
(Pulse sensor, Arduino,speaker, processing)
* Inhale and exhale mechanics

##Project 2- Don't Explore the Balloon
Due in a week
####My project is a keyboard which can detect the pressure when user types on keyboard. When pressure is above a certain level, the keyboard starts to inflate a balloonï¼›when pressure is under this level, the keyboard deflates the balloon. The balloon will eventually explode. Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* Design a mechanic that can inflate and deflate balloon
* Connect pressure sensor to detect when to blow the balloon
(pressure sensor, Arduino)


###(Alert)
##Project 3- Are U Sure?
Due in a week
####My project is a keyboard which can detect the pressure when user types on keyboard. When pressure is above a certain level, and hit send, the window pops out an alert asking if the user really want to send the message. Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* An alert when press send button 
(processing)
* Connect pressure sensor
(pressure sensor, Arduino)


###(facial recognition)
##Project 4- Emoji Me
Due in a week
####My project is a chat system which can detect user's facial emotion and auto send emoji. The system can show the user what his/her face look like when they are not aware of their emotion. Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* Crack the facial recognition software
(Affedex Me)
* interface design
(processing)
