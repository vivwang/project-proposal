##Inputs -keyboard

####Description
Design a keyboard with multiple keys to detect the speed keys are pressed and repeatable keys are pressed.


###Project 1- Breathe with Me
 
####Description
My project is a keyboard which can detect the speed when user types on keyboard. When speed is above a certain number, the computer will say,"please breathe with me", and also triggers a machine to pump up and down in a calmer tempo.
 
Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* Design a flexible machine which can accomplish inhale and exhale movement
* Play sound while it detects speed over a certain range
 
###Components
* Connect 1 button √
* Measure how long a button hold √
* Measure time difference between two presses √
* Connect 6 buttons √
* Measure the time difference between 1 & 2 button presses √
* Connect motor 
* Connect Arduino with Processing √
* Processing tts √
* Measure the repeatble signals from 1 button 


###Project 2- Soothing music
 
####Description
My project is a keyboard which can detect the speed when user types on keyboard. When speed is above a certain number, the computer will play a soothing music, until the user calms down.


###Project 3- Alarm
 
####Description
My project is a chat system, when keyboard detect user is angry when sending a message, the screen will sounded an alarm, and shows prevention tips.  

Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* chat input
* sound alarm 



##Inputs -Pulse Sensor

###Project 4- Breathe with Me
 
####Description
My project is using pulse sensor to detect user's heart beat, when hear is above a certain number, the computer will say,"please breathe with me", and also triggers a machine to pump up and down in a clamer tempo.

Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* Design a flexible keyboard which can accomplish inhale and exhale movement
(rubber keyboard cover)
* Play sound while it detects user's heart beat over a certain range
(Pulse sensor)
 

 
##Inputs- Facial Recognition

###Project 5- Face_emoji
 
####Description
My project can detect user's facial expression, when user is angry, it will lock keyboard functions and ask the user to match a set of happy emojis on screen to unlock keyboard. 

Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* Crack the facial recognition software

* interface design (processing)


###Project 6- Falling food
 
####Description
My project can detect user's facial expression, when user is sad, it will fall user's chosen comfort food on screen.

Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* falling motion (processing)
* how to choose food
 

###Project 7- Sad face
 
####Description
My project is a chat system which can detect user's facial expression, when user's typing emotion is different than facial expression, it will show user the real emotion on screen.
 

###Project 7- Empathy Machine
 
####Description
When detect user is sad, the machine will cry with user.  

Considering these functions, I defined some areas I need to explore as follow.
* mechanics that can pour water out
